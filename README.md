Development  of simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation
A simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation is a software application that secures image data by altering its pixel values. The tool operates by applying mathematical transformations, such as swapping pixel positions, modifying RGB values, or using bitwise operations. These techniques scramble the image's visual information, making it unintelligible to unauthorized viewers.

Key features of such a tool include:

Encryption Algorithm: A user-defined or predefined method for altering pixel data.
Key-Based Security: A unique key or password to encrypt and decrypt the image.
User Interface: Simple input for loading images and displaying encrypted/decrypted results.
Performance: Fast processing suitable for small to medium-sized images.
This method ensures basic confidentiality and is often used in secure image sharing or storage scenarios.
